# #Project-Description-📌
 PokeGPT is a challenge for the selection process to the Kodus startup internship program. The project proposes an API integrated with the ChatGPT API (https://openai.com/), which allows users to ask questions about Pokémon. Its main objective is to act as a proxy between the user and ChatGPT, specifically to answer questions about the Pokémon universe. The API receives a question from the user, sends it to ChatGPT, and then returns the answer obtained.
